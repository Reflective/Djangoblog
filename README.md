# Django Blog project

<p>
This is a learning project to familiarize myself with the Django framework.<br/>
I am following Corey Schafer's django tutorial series as a starting point, but I am planning on diverging once I am more comfortable in the environment.

<br/>
<br/>
I would like to use this as a starting point for an interactive portfolio site
